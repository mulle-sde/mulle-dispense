#  ðŸš° Copy build products and reorganize them 

... for Android, BSDs, Linux, macOS, SunOS, Windows (MinGW, WSL)

After having build something with your favorite build tool like `make`, this
tool will copy the build results to a destination folder. Essentially,
`mulle-dispense` is a shortcut for:

``` sh
cd build
cp -Rp include share lib bin "${DEPENDENCY_DIR}"
```

But headers can be reorganized to fit a canonical "subfolder for every library"
scheme. So `#include <zlib.h>` may become `#include <zlib/zlib.h>`.
