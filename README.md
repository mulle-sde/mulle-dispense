# mulle-dispense

ðŸš° Copy build products and reorganize them

![Last version](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/mulle-sde/mulle-dispense.svg)

... for Linux, OS X, FreeBSD, Windows


After having build something with your favorite build tool like `make`,
this tool will copy the build results to a destination folder.

Essentially, `mulle-dispense` is a shortcut for:

```
cd build
cp -Rp include share lib bin "${DEPENDENCY_DIR}"
```

But it is a bit more clever than that...

Headers can be reorganized to fit a canonical "subfolder for every library"
scheme, if so desired.
