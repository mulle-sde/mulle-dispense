# mulle-dispense, ðŸš° Copy build products and reorganize them

![Last version](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/{{PUBLISHER}}/mulle-dispense.svg)

... for Linux, OS X, FreeBSD, Windows


After having build something with your favorite build tool like `make`,
this tool will copy the results to a destination folder.

Headers can be reorganized to fit a canonical "subfolder for every library"
scheme, if so desired.

Executable          | Description
--------------------|--------------------------------
`mulle-dispense`    | Copy and reorganize build products


## Install

OS    | Command
------|------------------------------------

other | ./install.sh  (Requires: [mulle-bashfunctions](https://github.com/mulle-nat/mulle-bashfunctions))


## What mulle-dispense does

Essentially, `mulle-dispense` is a shortcut for:

```
cd build
cp -Ra include share lib bin "${DEPENDENCY_DIR}"
```

But mulle-dispense is a bit more clever than that.
